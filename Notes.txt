Assumption: If the snake can't move in a direction (is at edge of grid), just don't move

At this point, I believe the API is something that would
be usable by something that had an event listener to call
the API methods when keyboard events happened.

Since we are just building the API for the game, it seems out of
the assessment to implement the keyboard listener and utilize the API methods.
If I were utilizing this API, I would want to pick what key presses fire
off the direction changes, and this is a good position to be in in order to do that.

At this point, I don't know how I would fully encapsulate the running of the game and pass in events with just python files.
This is a shortcoming of my knowledge, and likely a result of Python not being my strongest language.
I am most used to working in the web browser, where event handling is quite common.

Most of my Python experience comes from AWS working with Lambda functions that are fired by API Gateway requests.
